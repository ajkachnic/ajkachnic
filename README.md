### hi, i'm andrew kachnic

i like building cool shit. particularly, i love building things that can connect people with technology in new ways.

if you think i'm cool, visit my [website](https://nullish.space) or reach out (~~i love being validated~~).

#### stuff

most things i build never see the light of day, but here's some random things that i've been working on:

- **[nighthawk](https://github.com/ajkachnic/nighthawk)** — experimental compiler written in python (eww) with QBE as the backend
- **[space](https://github.com/ajkachnic/space)** — note taking tool that uses vector embeddings to automatically cluster notes
